# 📖 Overview

This project presents a **Secure Satellite Communication and IoT Environmental Monitoring System** that combines **Computer Networks**, **Embedded Systems**, and **Internet of Things (IoT)** technologies.

The network infrastructure was designed and simulated using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, while the embedded monitoring system was implemented using an **ESP32 microcontroller** connected to environmental sensors.

The prototype demonstrates how secure communication, environmental monitoring, and autonomous protection logic can work together in a modern satellite ground station.
